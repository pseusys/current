# Lab 1

## Exercise 1

1. It converts ASCII-encoded PGM files (P2) to binary-encoded ones (P5) and vice versa.
2. It is stored inside of a pixel array (matrix) called `graymap`.
3. The first one reads and parses ASCII-encoded pixel value (ignoring whitespaces) and the second one reads binary pixel value.
4. In both cases integer is used for intensity storing.
5. The white color.
6. ASCII-encoded file has almost 4 times bigger size (1064037 butes) than binary-encoded one (262160 bytes).
