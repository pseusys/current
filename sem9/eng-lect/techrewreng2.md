Title: **Elefant-fishing project meeting on friday at 14.00**

Dear research team member,  
My name is Aleksandr Sergeev, I am doing my internship in our laboratory.
My internship topic is "Comparing of arctic elefant fishing with an elefant rod and elefant net", it introduces innovative ways of capturing arctic elefants in the wild.  
I would like to present some of my approaches to the team on Friday at 14.00.
The meeting will take place on the laboratory 1st floor and will last for approximately 45 minutes.
Be sure to come if you feel interested - every participant will have a chance to try catching an arctic elefant himself!  
Best regards and looking forward to seeing you,  
Aleksandr Sergeev.
