## E-mail: previous lecture mistake

Dear mr. Right,  
This evening I tried to revise the material you provided us with during the last lecture.
I was struggling with reproducing the proof of the theorem you have written on the blackboard.
Since I am not very confident about math, I doublechecked the calculations, and now I am almost sure the minus sign on the line #15 is missing (I am attaching the picture).
Maybe we could meet and discuss whatever I found out and which version of the proof is the correct one?
I would be glad to receive a feedback if maybe I missed something.  
Best regards,  
Aleksandr Sergeev

## Pitch: trains over buses

It's not a secret that trains are generally way cooler than planes.
There are some reasons for that:

1. Planes spend lots of fossil fuels and contribute to global warming, while trains can easily run on green electricity.
2. Train boarding takes several minutes, while plane boarding takes two to four hours, the choice is already obvious for everyone who values their time.
3. Train stations can be beautiful and integrated into city or landscape, while planes require enormous ugly runway to take off.
4. Travelling by plane is just a routine, while travilling by train is a specific culture: you can make friends with other passengers, eat special train fast food and relax merely watching the world passing by the window.
5. Trains have also a rich history: first steam-powered locomotives were key to industrial revolution, they made the world as we know it now (while planes have only made skies a less safe place).
<!-- 6. If a plane crashes passangers are stuck several kilometers above the ground, while if a train crashes passangers can just walk away. -->

Book your train ticket today and enjoy the railway magic tomorrow!
