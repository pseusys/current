# Presentations

> 15 minutes

Tell a **story** about the subject.

## Hardships

1. Speak about the content clearly and smoothly to the audience.
2. Get the audience's attention.
3. Transfer the knowledge to the audience.

## Slides

Slides must support the speech.
Good slides are "light" and "graphical".

### Light

- The denser - the worse! No one will read, the audience will get lost.
- Dense text can be bad for the speech: too much content without stopping, difficukt to keep track.

How to reduce text amount:
- Split text in more slides.
- Highlight small important parts.

Sides must allow both you and the audience to breathe.
- Add commas and periods - they change the text.
- Slide transitions don't help.

How to structure better:
- Outline separating content.
- Slides with little text with important parts well-lighted.
- Well-chained story.

### Graphical

Add images and figures!

A little of textual description is still required to summarize the message.

Also, any decorative images should not exaggerate slides.

## Presenting

- Should finish **on allocated time**: otherwise you will be either "cut out" or it will feel weird if you finish too early.
- Go "smoothly": highlight essential parts + add "breathing windows" for audience.
- It's fine if some parts don't go well, e.g. if you're stuck, it is important **how you get out** of these situations.

### Finishing on allocatedtime

- Control the amount of content.
- The lesser time you have the harder it is (90% of situations).
- **Speaking faster doesn't help!'**

How to control the amount of content?
- Practice and rehearse.
- Use a stopwatch to measure both overall and individual time per slide.
- Adjust content and speech according to the measured time.
- Do not compromise the presentation story.

### Going "smoothly"

How to present smoothly?
- Study the content: the more you know the easier it is to talk.
- Make pauses: commas and periods can help.
- Change vocal timbre to put emphasis in parts of the speech: advanced!

How to rehearse?
- Small fragments first.
- Starting at slide 1.
- Repeat a few times the slides you have issues with.
- From beginning to end.
- Starting at random slides.
- Without any slides.

How to avoid bad situations?
- Reduce tension.
- Practice breathing.
- Use "canned phrases", like:
    + Sorry, allow me to rephrase
    + Sorry, let me think for a second... ah, yes!
    + Sorry, there's a lot of content to present at this point, allow me to restart



## Task: presentation

> Inequality in society from economical point of view.

1. The society we live in is not equal in terms of resources, capabilites, social statuses, etc.
2. Although we may not like it, it appears to be natural: on a lower scale that's how our ancestors lived and that's how societies of animals are formed.
3. Even if we imagine all people suddenly become equal, there always will emerge someone who is a bit more initiative, smarter or stronger.
4. With time, this slight inequality somehow will resemble natural evolution, when children become even less equal than their parents.
4. On the other hand, we have to admit humans have achieved a certain progress fighting this inequality..
5. Today human life has become the global priority for our society and even the poorest people live better than several hundreds of years ago.
6. Moreover, in developed societies there exist numerous social lifts available for majority of people that can significantly increase networth of a person.
7. To sum up, I would like to say that although we can judge social inequality and we must fight it, more or less it is inevitable and natural.
