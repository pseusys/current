For now, the test that’s ready is as follows:
The garage door is initially opened.
When we’re first at the state powerup, the switch is on and don’t have an encryption key available, we move to state nokey.
In state nokey, we stay there until we get an encryption key.
When we get an encryption key, we move to state deactivated.
Later, we turn the switch off and go to the powerdown state.
After that, we put the switch on again and we go back to the powerup state.
Since we have an encryption key, then after we powerup again, we go to the deactivated state again.
